# Rain Prediction #
<br> Using different machine learning algorithm we predicted the rain propability. The project was one of the many project that was performed during the IMB AI engineering course. The basic of machine learning can be understood from this. In this we also learn to the evaluation metrics used in machine learning to assess the performance of classification models along with the accuracy and different parameters.

<br> You find the Rain prediction file in the same repository and you can perform it for yourself to understand the basic of machine learning and its different algorithms
